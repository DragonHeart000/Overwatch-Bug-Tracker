# Overwatch-Bug-Tracker
Overwatch Bug Tracker is a website designed to help keep track of bugs in Overwatch, specifically out of bounds bugs.

Inspired by: https://github.com/geri43/CSGOBugTracker-outdated-

Overwatch patched about 90% of the bugs I knew of (even the ones I found myself that no one else knew of) in one change to Sombra's translocator. As such I am not planning on working on this anymore. It hardly got anywhere and as such is not a great loss. Feel free to use anything in here for your own projects. If I have a lot of time in the future and know as many bugs as I used to then this perhaps I'll get on this again.
